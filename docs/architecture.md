# Chimera OS Architecture

## The Heart and The Brain: A Hybrid Design

Chimera OS is designed around a hybrid architecture, distinguishing between the low-level, deterministic functions of a traditional operating system kernel (the "Heart") and the high-level, strategic decision-making capabilities of an integrated AI (the "Brain").

### The Heart (Microkernel)

The Heart of Chimera OS is a lean microkernel, primarily written in C and Assembly. Its responsibilities are strictly limited to:

*   **Hardware Abstraction:** Managing direct interaction with CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
*   **Process Execution:** Handling the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
*   **Memory Safety:** Ensuring processes operate within their allocated memory spaces.
*   **Synapse Layer:** Providing a secure and efficient communication channel to the AI Brain.

This minimalist approach to the kernel ensures stability, security, and predictability for critical system operations.

### The Brain (AI Decision Layer)

The Brain of Chimera OS is where the intelligence resides. This AI layer, which will be implemented using advanced language models and decision-making algorithms, will be responsible for:

*   **Resource Management:** Dynamically allocating CPU time, memory, and other system resources based on user intent, system load, and predictive analysis.
*   **Task Scheduling:** Optimizing the execution order of processes to improve responsiveness and efficiency.
*   **User Intent Interpretation:** Translating natural language commands and user behavior into actionable system operations.
*   **System Optimization:** Learning from system usage patterns to proactively adjust configurations and resource allocation.

### The Synapse (API Bridge)

The critical link between the Heart and the Brain is the "Synapse"â€”a well-defined API and communication protocol. This layer ensures that the kernel can query the AI for strategic decisions and receive structured responses that it can then execute. This design allows for the AI to evolve and be updated independently of the core kernel, providing flexibility and future-proofing.

## Future Directions

Future development will focus on:

*   Refining the Synapse API for richer communication.
*   Implementing initial AI decision-making modules for basic resource allocation.
*   Developing a conversational shell that leverages the AI for user interaction.
*   Expanding hardware support and device drivers.
